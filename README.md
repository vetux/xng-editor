# xEditor
Qt5 Editor for creating games with xEngine

# Notes
The editor is currently just a barebones POC of the features it will provide. 

Serious work on this project will resume once the xEngine has reached a more stable api.

# Building
- Clone and build the [xEngine](https://github.com/xenotux/xng) 
- Load [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and build the editor target
